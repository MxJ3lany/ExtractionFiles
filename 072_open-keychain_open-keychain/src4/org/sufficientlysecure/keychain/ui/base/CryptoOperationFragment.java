/** This is a base class for fragments which implement a cryptoOperation.
 *
 * Subclasses of this class can call the cryptoOperation method to execute an
 * operation in KeychainService which takes a parcelable of type T as its input
 * and returns an OperationResult of type S as a result.
 *
 * The input (of type T) is not given directly to the cryptoOperation method,
 * but must be provided by the overridden createOperationInput method to be
 * available upon request during execution of the cryptoOperation.
 *
 * After running cryptoOperation, one of the onCryptoOperation*() methods will
 * be called, depending on the success status of the operation. The subclass
 * must override at least onCryptoOperationSuccess to proceed after a
 * successful operation.
