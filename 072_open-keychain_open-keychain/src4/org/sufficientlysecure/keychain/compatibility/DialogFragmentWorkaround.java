/**
 * Bug on Android >= 4.2. Fixed in 4.2.2 ?
 * 
 * http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=41901
 * 
 * DialogFragment disappears on pressing home and coming back. This also happens especially in
 * FileDialogFragment after launching a file manager and coming back.
 * 
 * Usage: <code>
 * DialogFragmentWorkaround.INTERFACE.runnableRunDelayed(new Runnable() {
 *          public void run() {
 *              // show dialog...
 *          }
 *      });
 * </code>
