/** This is an immutable and parcelable class which stores the full s2k parametrization
 * of an encrypted secret key, i.e. all fields of the {@link S2K} class (type, hash algo,
 * iteration count, iv) plus the encryptionAlgorithm. This class is intended to be used
 * as key in a HashMap for session key caching purposes, and overrides the
 * {@link #hashCode} and {@link #equals} methods in a suitable way.
 *
 * Note that although it is a rather unlikely scenario that secret keys of the same key
 * are encrypted with different ciphers, the encryption algorithm still determines the
 * length of the specific session key and thus needs to be considered for purposes of
 * session key caching.
